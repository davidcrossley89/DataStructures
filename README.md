# DataStructures
Recreating data structures in order to gain familiarity and practice in C#

This is a repo I made to contain all my work with data structures and algorithms.  I find it's easier 
to learn these by re-creating them from scratch.  If you're looking for a study tool, delete a method 
and recreate it yourself.  Otherwise, this repo is fairly useless.
